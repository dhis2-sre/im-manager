* create an error that contains the executed go template, so the yaml helmfile
  print it in case yaml parsing failed. this helps in figuring out what is wrong.
* should I call the fields envs/requiredEnvs in the parser? since they come from these functions
  or should I call them optionalParams/requiredParams
* check if I can declare the assert/require before subtests and reuse them in there
* add docs. explain why the parsing of the helmfile template is needed in the way we do it

* remove tests that only helped in migrating parsers
* remove metadata comments in helmfile.yaml
* remove old parser code
