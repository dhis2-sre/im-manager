* parse im-metadata in loader and pass to parser tmpl
* create an error that contains the executed go template, so the yaml helmfile
  print it in case yaml parsing failed. this helps in figuring out what is wrong.
* optional/required parameters are not system parameters like

	[]string{"INSTANCE_ID", "INSTANCE_NAME", "INSTANCE_HOSTNAME", "INSTANCE_NAMESPACE", "IM_ACCESS_TOKEN"}

  or stack parameters

* should I call the fields envs/requiredEnvs in the parser? since they come from these functions
  or should I call them optionalParams/requiredParams
* check if I can declare the assert/require before subtests and reuse them in there
